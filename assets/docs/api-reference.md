### Organization settings

`PUT /organization` accepts `{name?, settings?}`; `settings` keys (all optional, merged over the
stored ones): `timezone` (IANA name), `auto_enrich_iocs` (bool), `enrichment_allow_amber_strict`
(bool), `ai_tlp_policy` (`{white|green|amber|amber_strict|red: allow|local_only|block}`, defaults
`red`/`amber_strict` → `local_only`, others `allow`) and `registration_enabled` (bool, default
organization only, otherwise `400 not_applicable`). Self-registration is **closed by default**.
Every change is audited with a before/after diff; loosening the AI policy for any TLP level also
records an `ai_tlp_policy_loosened` security event.

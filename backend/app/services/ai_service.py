"""AI service for generating incident reports and summaries using LLM providers.

TLP egress policy (organization setting ``ai_tlp_policy``)
---------------------------------------------------------
Every AI call carries the incident's TLP (required ``incident_tlp=`` kwarg) and
goes through ``_select_provider``, the single enforcement point:

* ``allow``      — any configured provider;
* ``local_only`` — only ``ollama`` / ``openai_compatible`` whose base URL host
  is non-public AND on ``OUTBOUND_URL_ALLOWLIST`` (cloud providers refused);
* ``block``      — no provider.

Defaults (missing / invalid keys fall back to them): ``red`` and
``amber_strict`` -> ``local_only``; ``amber``, ``green``, ``white`` -> ``allow``.
A refusal raises ``AIBlockedByTLP`` (403 ``ai_blocked_by_tlp``) and records a
``security_event / ai_blocked_by_tlp``. Explicit requests surface the 403;
automatic paths fall back (deterministic report) or skip.

All LLM network calls live in this module (a test enforces it).

## Why SheetStorm?

Many security teams still coordinate incidents through shared spreadsheets. They're familiar and fast to set up — until concurrent edits collide, context gets lost, audit trails vanish, and there's zero integration with the tools responders actually need.

SheetStorm is a **free, open-source alternative** purpose-built for DFIR practitioners. It covers the full NIST incident response lifecycle and is designed to be useful whether you're a **solo analyst learning the ropes**, a **training lab instructor**, or part of an **in-house DFIR team or IR consultancy**.

```
Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned
```

> SheetStorm is a DFIR **investigation tracker** - the structured replacement for the SANS incident-response spreadsheet - not a SIEM, SOAR, or SOC alert-triage platform. It doesn't aim to replace commercial SOAR platforms. It fills the gap between ad-hoc spreadsheets and heavyweight enterprise tools — giving every responder access to structured, collaborative IR for free.

## What's New

- MITRE ATT&CK suggestions now use an organization-scoped pattern model and ranked `/mitre/suggest` service.
- Tasks tab redesign adds search, status, priority, and assignee filters.
- Tasks are read-only for viewers, while task and comment deletion are administrator-only.
- Case notes enforce viewer read-only behavior, with note deletion restricted to administrators.
- Teams and organizational roles are backed by shipped migrations for `teams`, `team_members`, and user `organizational_role`.
- Stability fixes include null-safe storage analytics, IOC timeline duplicate suggestion-state cleanup, and a linearized Alembic migration chain.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7a336e6e/sheetstorm.git && cd sheetstorm
chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
```

That's it. The script generates secrets, builds 6 Docker containers, runs migrations, and seeds an admin user.

> **Local access works over plain HTTP** on `http://localhost:8080` / `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. For any other host or IP use HTTPS (see [Deployment](#deployment)).

| Service    | URL                              |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Proxy      | http://127.0.0.1:8080            |
| Frontend   | http://127.0.0.1:3000            |
| API        | http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1     |
| MCP Server | http://127.0.0.1:8811/sse        |

> **First login:** `admin@sheetstorm.local` (`ADMIN_EMAIL`). Leave `ADMIN_PASSWORD` empty in `.env` and the seed step prints a random password **once** in the `start.sh` output (it is not stored anywhere); otherwise it is the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set. You must choose a new password at first sign-in. Registration is closed by default: add further users from **Admin → Users** (invite links or accounts).

### Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose v2
- 2 GB RAM minimum (4 GB recommended)

### Optional Integrations

Configure via environment variables in `.env` or throught the GUI in the platform:

| Integration | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **OpenAI / Gemini** | AI-generated incident reports |
| **VirusTotal** | IOC and file reputation lookups |
| **MISP** | Push IOCs to a MISP instance |
| **Google Drive** | Cloud artifact storage per case |
| **Slack** | Notification webhooks |
| **S3-compatible** | External artifact storage backend |

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `.env` (copied from `.env.example`; never commit it). Highlights:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `FERNET_KEY` | Generated by `start.sh`; required in production |
| `CUSTODY_SIGNING_KEY` | HMAC key for chain-of-custody signatures. Generate once with `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`; do not rotate casually (see [Configuration](assets/docs/configuration.md#custody-signing-key-and-rotation)) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`, `FRONTEND_URL` | Set to your public origin when not using localhost |
| `JWT_COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` by default in production (HTTPS only cookies) |
| `OUTBOUND_URL_ALLOWLIST` | Hosts/CIDRs self-hosted integrations (Ollama, MISP, ...) may target, e.g. `ollama,misp.internal,10.0.0.0/8` |
| `IOC_AUTO_ENRICH` | `false` by default; enables automatic third-party IOC enrichment |

The full list (AI providers, storage, SSO, MCP) is in [assets/docs/configuration.md](assets/docs/configuration.md).

## Deployment

- **HTTPS is required for non-localhost use.** Auth cookies are `Secure` in production, so logging in over `http://<lan-ip>:8080` silently fails. Terminate TLS in front of the bundled proxy (Cloudflare Tunnel, load balancer, Caddy, ...) and set `FRONTEND_URL` and `CORS_ORIGINS` to the `https://` origin. Only on a trusted network, `JWT_COOKIE_SECURE=false` allows plain HTTP.
- **Migrations run automatically.** The backend applies `flask db upgrade` on every start (with retries) and exits with an error if it fails, so a fresh `docker compose up` yields a working schema and a broken one is never served.
- **Client IPs behind a load balancer/CDN:** by default the bundled proxy trusts no forwarded-IP headers (safe for direct exposure). If you run behind Cloudflare, Traefik, an ALB, etc., set `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` and `REAL_IP_HEADER` - see [Running behind a reverse proxy / CDN](assets/docs/configuration.md#running-behind-a-reverse-proxy--cdn).
- **Back up** the `postgres_data` and `artifacts_data` volumes and your `.env` (especially `FERNET_KEY` and `CUSTODY_SIGNING_KEY`).
- **Tests:** backend tests run in Docker with `./backend/tests/run_in_docker.sh` (see [Development](assets/docs/development.md#testing)).
